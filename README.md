# Tango
This library provides a simple framework for a swing-based database application.

## Building

To build, type `mvn clean install`

This version of the code requires Java 17 or later to build and run.

I am using Maven version 3.9.9. It worked with java 21 and earlier. There may be earlier versions of Maven that 
work just as well, but I haven't looked into this.
