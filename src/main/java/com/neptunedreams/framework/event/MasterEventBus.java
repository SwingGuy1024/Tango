/**
 * This class serves as a facade for the event bus. The event bus instance is private, and all methods to post an event
 * are static methods in this class. This makes it easier to keep track of the events.
 * <p>
 * Under no circumstances should the EventBus instance be made available to other classes. By requiring all posts
 * to be done by static methods, we make it possible to use multiple EventBuses in a project, each with its own 
 * set of post methods. This design guarantee that a message can't get posted to the wrong EventBus.
 * The only mistake that can get made is registering a class with the wrong event bus. Consequently, 
 * each facade class should also have a unique name for its register method.
